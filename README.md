# Seaside Sunrise for VSCode

**_Personal C# Dark theme for Visual Studio Code, featuring calming shades of purple, blue and orange_**

---

Dark theme with gentle shades of purple, blue and orange, with an occasional red, aiming to favor readability and reduce strain due to overly vibrant colors.

Inspired by, and based on, [mojo](https://github.com/albert-perlman/mojo-vscode-theme), [eppz!](https://github.com/Geri-Borbas/VSCode.Extension.eppz_Code), [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) and [The Community Material Theme](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-community-material-theme)

Currently supports `C#`, `JSON`, `XML` and `Markdown`
